# Trinity Wallet - eIDAS 2.0 Compliant Digital Identity Wallet

Trinity Wallet is an eIDAS 2.0 compliant digital identity wallet designed for Trinity College students. It leverages Microsoft Azure for authentication, OpenID4VCI for credential issuance, OpenID4VP for credential presentation, and encrypted SQLite (SQLCipher) for on-device storage. BLE capabilities are integrated to unlock smart locks, and ECDSA-based signing allows for secure digital signatures. **It serves as a robust blueprint for building digital identity wallets compliant with eIDAS 2.0 standards.**
